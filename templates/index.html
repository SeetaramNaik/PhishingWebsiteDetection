            <h2>ðŸ‘‰ What is a Phishing Website?</h2>
            <p>A phishing website is a fake website that is designed to look like a legitimate website in order to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</p>
            <p>Phishing websites are often distributed via email or social media messages that appear to be from a trusted source.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ‘‰ How to Detect a Phishing Website</h2>
            <p>Here are some signs that a website may be a phishing website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The URL is slightly different from the legitimate website (e.g. paypal.com vs. paypa1.com)</li>
                <li>The website has a lot of spelling or grammatical errors</li>
                <li>The website asks for sensitive information that it shouldn't need (e.g. your Social Security number when signing up for a free trial)</li>
                <li>The website uses a non-secure connection (HTTP instead of HTTPS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you suspect that a website may be a phishing website, it's best to avoid entering any sensitive information and to report the website to the appropriate authorities.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ‘‰ Here are just few phishing related risks posed by mobile device use:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Apps</b> - lack built-in security. Free apps usually ask for a lot of access they shouldnâ€™t need.</li>
                <li><b>WiFi</b> - your device typically picks up the strongest signal, which may be a rogue WiFi that seems legitimate but is actually an attacker just waiting to monitor, intercept or even alter communications from your device.</li>
                <li><b>Bluetooth</b> - can be used to spread viruses, and hackers can use it to hack into phones to access and exploit your organizationâ€™s data.</li>
                <li><b>Human error</b> - thieves sell lost and stolen devices to buyers who are more interested in the data than the device itself.</li>
                <li><b>Smishing</b> - aka phishing conducted via SMS. Similar to phishing emails, an example of a smishing text might attempt to entice a victim into revealing personal information. asking the recipient to take action on any number of seemingly mundane activities, i.e., the userâ€™s bank claiming it has detected unusual activity or a congratulatory notice saying the person has won a prize from their favorite store.</li>
