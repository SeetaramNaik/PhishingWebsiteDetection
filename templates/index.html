            <h2>ðŸ‘‰ What is a Phishing Website?</h2>
            <p>A phishing website is a fake website that is designed to look like a legitimate website in order to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</p>
            <p>Phishing websites are often distributed via email or social media messages that appear to be from a trusted source.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ‘‰ How to Detect a Phishing Website</h2>
            <p>Here are some signs that a website may be a phishing website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The URL is slightly different from the legitimate website (e.g. paypal.com vs. paypa1.com)</li>
                <li>The website has a lot of spelling or grammatical errors</li>
                <li>The website asks for sensitive information that it shouldn't need (e.g. your Social Security number when signing up for a free trial)</li>
                <li>The website uses a non-secure connection (HTTP instead of HTTPS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you suspect that a website may be a phishing website, it's best to avoid entering any sensitive information and to report the website to the appropriate authorities.</p>
